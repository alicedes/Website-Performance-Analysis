# Website Performance Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project aims to provide an analysis of website performance using AWS services, particularly Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service). The analysis will focus on answering 10 specific questions related to the performance of the website. 

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate familiarity with the AWS console and the use of database services like RDS. By conducting an in-depth analysis of website performance, students will gain insights into factors affecting user experience and overall site efficiency.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. What is the average response time of the website?
2. How does website performance vary by time of day?
3. Are there any correlations between website traffic and response time?
4. What are the most visited pages on the website?
5. Which geographical regions contribute the most to website traffic?
6. Is there any correlation between website performance and browser type?
7. How do different devices (desktop, mobile, tablet) affect website performance?
8. Are there any noticeable patterns in website performance over time?
9. What are the peak traffic hours for the website?
10. Are there any outliers or anomalies in website performance data?

## Data Source and Setup

- The website performance data is stored in an Amazon RDS instance.
- Data may include metrics such as response time, page visits, geographic information, browser type, and device type.
- AWS CloudWatch may also be used to collect additional performance metrics.

## Analysis Tools and Techniques

- Utilize SQL queries to extract and analyze data from the RDS database.
- Use visualization tools such as Matplotlib or Plotly to create graphs and charts for better understanding of trends and patterns.
- Apply statistical analysis techniques to identify correlations and anomalies in the data.

## Presentation and Reporting

- Prepare a business report presentation outlining the findings of the analysis.
- Structure the presentation to address each of the 10 key questions with clear insights and actionable recommendations.
- Provide visual aids such as charts, graphs, and tables to support the analysis.

## AWS Setup Instructions

1. Set up an AWS account if you haven't already.
2. Launch an Amazon RDS instance with the appropriate database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. Configure security groups and access control to ensure secure access to the RDS instance.
4. Import the website performance data into the RDS database.
5. Optionally, set up AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring of website performance metrics.

## Conclusion

The analysis of website performance using AWS and RDS provides valuable insights into user experience, traffic patterns, and potential areas for improvement. By addressing the 10 key questions outlined in this project, students will gain a deeper understanding of website performance metrics and their implications for business success.
